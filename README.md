Semicon
========

An efficient minecraft logic circuit mod

Although minecraft original redstone can simulate logic circuit, but it is slow and tricky. The reason is redstone block state is evaluated one by one.

Different from redstone, semicon is based on event driving algorithm, which is adopted by most logic circuit simulation software. That makes semicon is significantly high performance.
